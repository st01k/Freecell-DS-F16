Refine all documents from Week 1 (from Gary):

    Relational Diagram that more appropriately depicts OOP

    UML refinement with color-coded class cards, main attribs, and business methods

    Work on specifications documentation. New file from template with game rules as specs.

    Master attrib/method list (for easy transition to diagram)

    Convert all documents to PDF prior to submission
    
Project specific goals:

    Engine mechanics rough design

    Board mechanics rough design

    Turn mechanics rough design

    Basic card/deck operation

    Basic cli

    GUI design/basic operation merge to develop (doesn't need much functionality yet).
