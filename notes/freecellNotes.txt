 
Freecell
 Freecell is played with one card deck. You have four free cells in the top left corner. In addition there are four foundation piles, and eight playing piles below. 
 The goal of the game is to have all cards as real families ascending on the foundation. You can achieve this often if you know how to play: Freecell is solvable at a rate of 99.9% approximately â€” of the first 32,000 deals there is only one unsolvable (11,982 if you want to know). 
 In the playing piles you have to build descending sequences, where red and black cards alternate. You can put any card in a free cell. 
 You can only move one card that lays on top of a pile or a free cell. Sequences can only be moved if you have enough free space (either free cells or free playing piles) to place the cards. 
 The maximum amount of cards you can move is calculated by: 
 (#{free cells} + 1) * 2#{free piles} 
 To solve this game it is recommended to grab the cards out of the playing sequences in the same order they have to be put into the foundation (first the aces, then the twos, etc.) 
 You should try to keep as many free cells and/or playing piles empty, so you can build sequences as long as possible.
