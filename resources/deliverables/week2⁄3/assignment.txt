    UML refinement with color-coded class cards, main attribs, and business methods

    Work on specifications documentation. New file from template with game rules as specs.

    Master attrib/method list (for easy transition to diagram)

    Convert all documents to PDF prior to submission
    
Project specific goals:

    Engine mechanics rough design

    Board mechanics rough design

    Turn mechanics rough design

    Basic cli

    GUI design/basic operation merge to develop (doesn't need much functionality yet).

On BlackBoard:

Working through Chapter 9 will provide some very good information on how to develop a good Object Oriented design.  A good design minimizes coding time as well as troubleshooting code after it has been written and is being tested.  Review the web links on the Model View Control (MVC) design pattern and building java based GUI's, including the use of Eclipse Vi8sual Editor (VE).

Perform the following activities, submit them and be prepared to present them:

    Refine your list of software "things" you will need to implement this project (word doc)
    Refine your set of objects (classes) with class diagrams providing class name and preliminary attribute list and important methods(PDF).  Be sure to include all interfaces and/or abstract classes you will be using
    Refine upir object relationship diagram showing how the various objects identified at this point will interact with each other
    Provide information including classes, etc,  on how you will develop your User Interface
