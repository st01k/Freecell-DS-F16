 
Freecell
 Freecell is played with one card deck. You have four free cells in the top left corner. In addition there are four foundation piles, and eight playing piles below. 
 The goal of the game is to have all cards as real families ascending on the foundation. You can achieve this often if you know how to play: Freecell is solvable at a rate of 99.9% approximately â€” of the first 32,000 deals there is only one unsolvable (11,982 if you want to know). 
 In the playing piles you have to build descending sequences, where red and black cards alternate. You can put any card in a free cell. 
 You can only move one card that lays on top of a pile or a free cell. Sequences can only be moved if you have enough free space (either free cells or free playing piles) to place the cards. 
 The maximum amount of cards you can move is calculated by: 
 ({free cells} + 1) * 2{free piles} 
 To solve this game it is recommended to grab the cards out of the playing sequences in the same order they have to be put into the foundation (first the aces, then the twos, etc.) 
 You should try to keep as many free cells and/or playing piles empty, so you can build sequences as long as possible.

As the game begins, Klondike deals all the cards from the deck face up into the tableau.
The Game

The object of the game is to build all the cards face up on the foundations. Each foundation builds upward, in sequence, starting with the Ace. Only aces may be moved to an empty foundation, and only the next higher card of the same suit can be added to the foundation.

Only one card at a time may be moved in FreeCell, either the top card of a tableau column or the single card which was placed in a free cell. As a short cut, Klondike allows you to move a legal sequence of cards from one column to another, provided there are enough empty cells to have made this move one card at a time. The move will be scored as if you had moved one card at a time.

Only the next higher card of the same suit can be added to each foundation. Cards may be moved to the foundation from the tableau or a free cell.

Any card may be moved to an empty free cell or an empty tableau column.

A card may be added to a non-empty column in the tableau only if it is the next lower value than the current top card and of alternating color. For example, only the 9 of hearts or diamonds (red suits) may play on the 10 of spades (a black suit).
