turn    --> move played, turn created, sent to engine (move num, details)
engine  --> gets turn, sends to board
board	--> applies turn, returns board to engine
engine	--> gets new board
            creates new state (snapshot), sends to history stack
            sends board to boardGraph to be used in solver
gui     --> gets history.peek.getBoard() for paint
            gets other status info from .getTurn().getMoveNum()
                                        .getTurn().getSolvable()
            (need something for backwards traversal for 'undo' (stack on doubly linked list?))
            (same for redo, forward traversal through history without removal until/if a new path is made)

history --> stack of states (bc will need num moves and solution as to not recalculate)
state	--> board, turn, solution
